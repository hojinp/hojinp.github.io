### Welcome!

I am a Ph.D. candidate in the Computer Science Department at Carnegie Mellon University, co-advised by Prof. Greg Ganger and Prof. George Amvrosiadis.
I research autonomous storage and caching systems in public clouds, designing self-optimizing system configurations and resource provisioning strategies to minimize costs while achieving performance SLOs.
My work has been published at SOSP, SYSTOR, and HotCloud. Prior to CMU, I worked on distributed deep learning systems at Seoul National University, with publications in EuroSys and ICDCS.


<span style="color: blue;">**ðŸ“¢ I am seeking industry Research Scientist positions starting in 2025. Iâ€™d be happy to connect and discuss opportunities. Feel free to reach out at hojinp at andrew dot cmu dot edu.**</span>
